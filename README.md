# Automated Caesar Cipher Decoder

This project is a Flask-based web application that automatically decodes Caesar Cipher-encrypted text using frequency analysis and a machine learning model. It intelligently predicts the shift key using a trained Random Forest Classifier and provides decoded output.

## Features

- **Frequency Analysis** for initial decryption guesses.
- **Machine Learning Model** (Random Forest) trained on Caesar cipher patterns.
- **Web Interface** built using Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Accurate Predictions** based on letter distribution in ciphertext.
